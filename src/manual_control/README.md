# manual_control

Reads SDL-standard Bluetooth controller input from `/joy` and sends manual
actuator commands.

`auto_handover_node` reuses this manual controller in `auto_drive.launch.py`.
It initially forwards private automatic actuator topics and ignores manual driving
inputs. X (SDL button 2) permanently blocks automatic commands for this run and
starts electrical braking. Fresh stationary ERPM for 0.5 seconds plus released
X/RT/LT/RB and centered steering allow manual control. Only joystick frames received
after handover can drive the vehicle. Missing telemetry or joystick input keeps
the node braking; there is no timed fallback into manual mode. Perception and BEV
preview continue throughout. The normal `actuator_commander_node` remains a
standalone manual controller without this automatic startup mode.

Current mapping:

```text
RT axis 5 (0.0 released, 1.0 pressed) -> acceleration
LT axis 4 (0.0 released, 1.0 pressed) -> VESC electrical brake current
left stick X axis 0 -> steering angle
RB button 10 -> forward/reverse toggle (reserved until duty 0 while moving)
```

`actuator_commander_node` starts stopped in forward gear. RT increases the
command duty, LT takes priority and switches the VESC to brake-current mode,
and RB toggles forward/reverse. If RB is pressed while duty is non-zero or
LT braking is active, the change is reserved and engages automatically in the
control cycle where command duty reaches 0; pressing RB again cancels the
reservation. A pedal input timeout or a handover into MANUAL clears it. With the configured
`immediate_stop_on_accelerator_release: false`,
releasing RT follows the coast deceleration rate. Current gear and command duty are
published on `/manual/gear` and `/manual/current_duty`; the ramped electrical
brake command is published on `/manual/current_brake_current`. The VESC node publishes measured ERPM on
`/vesc/measured_erpm` and logs target duty and measured ERPM together.

`actuator_commander_node` reads all four controls directly from the same `/joy`
frame. The former intermediate converter and four manual input topics are not
used by `manual_drive.launch.py`. RB changes gear only on its rising edge, so
holding the button does not repeat the change.

The manual controller runs at 80 Hz. Its configured duty limits and ramps are:

Controller state and VESC command topics use `KEEP_LAST(1)` best-effort QoS.
Holding RT or a steering input therefore replaces the pending state instead of
accumulating old commands. When `/joy` stops, the 0.30-second watchdog sends
duty 0 and centers steering. When serial I/O is temporarily delayed, the VESC
node processes only the newest waiting duty/ERPM/servo command.

```yaml
forward_max_duty: 0.10
reverse_max_duty: 0.08
start_duty: 0.05
reverse_start_duty: 0.05
acceleration_duty_per_sec: 0.03
coast_deceleration_duty_per_sec: 0.04
maximum_brake_current_amps: 8.0
brake_current_rise_amps_per_sec: 16.0
brake_current_fall_amps_per_sec: 32.0
immediate_stop_on_accelerator_release: false
```

`coast_deceleration_duty_per_sec` is used only when
`immediate_stop_on_accelerator_release` is `false`. Full LT reaches 8 A in
approximately 0.5 seconds and releases it in approximately 0.25 seconds.
While any brake current remains, propulsion duty is cleared and not published.
The 8 A ROS limit is intentionally far below the supplied VESC motor-brake and
battery-regen limits; first powered checks must still be done at low speed.

## ROI VFH GUI 전환

`vfh_handover_node`는 `roi_vfh_test preview.launch.py`용 양방향 전환 어댑터다.
기존 수동 프로필과 `HandoverState`의 최신 ERPM·정지 유지·중립 확인을 재사용한다.
요청은 `id|MANUAL|stop_current` 또는 `id|AUTO|stop_current`, ACK는 같은 id와 실제 상태를 전송한다.
이전 두 필드 요청도 지원한다. 선택 제동 전류는 수동 프로필의 최대 전류 이하여야 한다.
실제 actuator 출력은 이 노드 하나만 소유하며 자동 명령은 volatile 전용 입력으로 받는다.
Stop으로 MANUAL, Start로 AUTO 복귀하며 X는 모드를 바꾸지 않는다.
기존 `auto_handover_node`의 auto_drive 단방향 X 전환 정책은 유지한다.
