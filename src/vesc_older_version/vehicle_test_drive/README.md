# vehicle_test_drive

Starts the VESC serial node, waits for a confirmed serial connection and ROS
command subscribers, then publishes a steering-servo sweep and ERPM ramps using
the same command path as manual control. Do not run `manual_control` command
publishers at the same time.

Sequence:

1. Servo position: 0.5 down to 0.1, then 0.1 up to 0.9 in 0.1 steps.
2. ERPM: 0 to 5000 over 3 seconds.
3. Hold 5000 for 0.25 seconds, then ERPM 0 for 0.5 seconds.
4. ERPM: 0 to -5000 over 3 seconds, then hold for 0.25 seconds.
5. Stop at ERPM 0 and return the servo to 0.5.

Run the complete test, including VESC initialization:

```bash
ros2 launch vehicle_test_drive vehicle_test_drive.launch.py
```

Use a different serial port when needed:

```bash
ros2 launch vehicle_test_drive vehicle_test_drive.launch.py vesc_port:=/dev/ttyACM1
```
